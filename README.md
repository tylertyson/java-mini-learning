# java-mini-learning

Mini projects for learning principles in my Java book.

I am reading through a textbook titled "Java_A_Beginners_Guide_Eighth_Edition" and they have exercises for following along.
I have taken the spirit of the exercises but changed the actual contents and/or purpose so that I am not just following along but implementing the *idea* 
of what it wants me to achieve.
